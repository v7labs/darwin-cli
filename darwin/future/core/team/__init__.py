# Can't import * in this module because of a circular import problem specific to teams
# The TeamCore module can instantiate from a client, but the client needs to use the team backend module
# to request the object for team. To circumvent this there's a get_raw method in this module that returns
# the raw team object, which is then passed to the TeamCore module, but if we import * here it introduces the
# circular import problem.
