# Configuration file for the Sphinx documentation builder.
#
# This file only contains a selection of the most common options. For a full
# list see the documentation:
# https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html

# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.

import os
import sys
from typing import Any, Dict, List

from darwin.version import __version__

sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath("../darwin/"))


# -- Project information -----------------------------------------------------

project: str = "darwin-py"
copyright: str = "MIT License"
author: str = "V7"

# The full version, including alpha/beta/rc tags
release: str = __version__

# -- General configuration ---------------------------------------------------

# Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings. They can be
# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.
extensions: List[str] = [
    "sphinx.ext.viewcode",
    "sphinx.ext.napoleon",
    "sphinx.ext.autodoc",
]

# Add any paths that contain templates here, relative to this directory.
templates_path: List[str] = ["_templates"]

# List of patterns, relative to source directory, that match files and
# directories to ignore when looking for source files.
# This pattern also affects html_static_path and html_extra_path.
exclude_patterns: List[str] = []

autodoc_default_options = {
    "member-order": "bysource"  # See: https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/9853#issuecomment-970490628
}


# -- Options for HTML output -------------------------------------------------

# The theme to use for HTML and HTML Help pages.  See the documentation for
# a list of builtin themes.
#
html_theme: str = "sphinx_rtd_theme"

# Add any paths that contain custom static files (such as style sheets) here,
# relative to this directory. They are copied after the builtin static files,
# so a file named "default.css" will overwrite the builtin "default.css".
html_static_path: List[str] = ["_static"]

# This is a hack so we can have the left menu bar expand automatically upon opening a page.
# This hack is needed because of a bug in Sphinx:
# https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme/issues/455
#
# If one day the bug gets fixed, then `html_js_files` and `html_theme_options` can be removed
# as well as the files/directories they rely on.
html_js_files: List[str] = ["js/custom.js"]
html_theme_options: Dict[str, Any] = {
    "collapse_navigation": False,
}
